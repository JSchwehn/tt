tt is a time tracker for the command line.


Introduction
============
I looked around for a time tracking tool that can be used from the command line
independent from the computer I use. I did not find any solution I wanted to 
use over a longer period.
That said, tt is tailored for my (very basic) needs: To keep an eye on my
working hours when I am in home office and to track time whenever I work on one
of my side projects. Until now, I used a macOS-only solution called Tyme2. I
liked it a lot and wanted to have something comparable on the shell using an
open and human-readable file format.


Installation
============
I tried to keep tt as simple as possible. It has been written in Python 3 but
does not have any external dependencies so far. This makes the installation
easy as long as you have Python 3 (not 2!) installed on your machine:
  1. Clone the project or download it as an archive and unpack it
  2. Move the tt file to some location existing in your PATH
     (or create a symlink)
  3. If you don't like the name: rename the file or create a symlink


Usage
=====
Generic commands 
     init                  Initialize new data file
     st                    Display tracker status information
 
Projects 
     a project name        Add new project with name "project name"
     d 23                  Delete project with id 23
     l                     List projects and their ids
 
Tracking 
     s                     Show tracked times for all projects
     s 23                  Show tracked times for project 23
     start 23              Starts time tracking for project id 23
     stop                  Stops active time tracking

Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

I don't like the name tt
------------------------
You are free to rename it or create a symlink with some name you really like.
This should not cause any problems.

I don't like the data file's name
---------------------------------
You can change the program and specify a data file name you like. It is open
source software for exactly that reason (and others...)

I found a bug!
--------------
Great. I would be happy to hear from you. You can either contact me via
GitHub or - even better - you can fix the bug and send a pull request that
allows me to merge your fix into the main branch.

I want to use tt on several computers, how can I synchronize the data?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually, this is also my use case. I initialize a new datafile on one
of my computers, move it to my Dropbox folder and create a symlink in my
home directory pointing to this file. I create this symlink on all machines
where I want to use tt:
	1. tt init
	2. mv .tymetracker.json ~/Dropbox/tymetracker.json
	3. ln -s ~/Dropbox/tymetracker.json ~/.tymetracker.json
Whenever you modify your local data it is synced to the other machines.
Yes, you can use other synchronization tools as well. 

I want to use my phone as time tracking device. Is there an app?
----------------------------------------------------------------
Hipster.
But you can create a virtual machine at Amazon, install your favorite
operating system and run tt via SSH.
