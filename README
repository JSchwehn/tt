Time tracker for the command line: tymetracker/tt


Introduction
============
I looked around for a time tracking tool that can be used from the command line
independent from the computer I use. I did not find any solution I wanted to 
use over a longer period, and furthermore I was motivated to hack away a small
tool that fits my needs.
That said, tt is tailored for my (very basic) needs: Keep an eye on my working
time when I work from home and to track time whenever I work on one of my side
projects. Until now, I used a macOS-only solution called Tyme2. I liked it a
lot and wanted to have something comparable on the shell using an open and
human-readable file format.


Installation
============
I tried to keep tt as simple as possible. It has been written in Python 3 but
does not have any external dependencies so far. This makes the installation
easy as long as you have Python 3 (not 2!) installed on your machine:
	1. Clone the project or download it as an archive and unpack it
	2. Move the tt.py file to some location existing in your PATH
	3. If you don't like the name: rename the file or create a symlink


Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

I don't like the name tt.py
---------------------------
You are free to rename it or create a symlink with some name you really like.
Really, this should not cause any problems.

I don't like the data file's name
---------------------------------
You can change the program and specify a data file name you like. It is open
source software for exactly that reason (and others...)

I found a bug!
--------------
Great. I would be happy to hear about that. You can either contact my via
GitHub or - even better - you can fix the bug and send a pull request that
allows me to merge your fix into the main branch.

I want to use tt on several computers, how can I synchronize the data?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Actually, this is also my use case. I start with init a new datafile on one
of my computers, move it to my Dropbox folder and create a symlink in my
home directory pointing to this file. I create this symlink on all machines
where I want to use tt:
	1. tt init
	2. mv .tymetracker.json ~/Dropbox/tymetracker.json
	3. ln -s ~/Dropbox/tymetracker.json ~/.tymetracker.json
Whenever you modify your local data it is synced to the other machines.
Yes, you can use other synchronization tools as well. 

I want to use my phone as time tracking device. Is there an app?
----------------------------------------------------------------
Hipsters.
